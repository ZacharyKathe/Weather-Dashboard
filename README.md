# Weather-Dashboard
## Made with jQuery, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. 
#### For this I pulled data from Open Weather Map's API. Using Javascript, I created tags and dynamically populated the html page. The goal of this was to manipulate the Dom and JSON data to dynamically style style a page with weather data. I picked a zip code instead of a city because I feel it's more localized without giving uo functionality of the app.
